# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
This is an analysis of Kickstarter data complied for a client who wants to create a theater production and needs to fundraise. Possible challenges would be the vagueness of the task and little information given by the client.  


## Questions

	Conclusions from the analysis show May has the most successful launch date while December had the least successful Theater productions. Therefore, productions released in the summer have more success than in the winter. There were not canceled productions in October however there was a spike in failed productions. Productions with goals above $45,999 saw little success. Goals between $1-$4900 $35,000-$4499 had the most success.   

	This dataset is limited by the fact it is only looking at Kickstarter fundraisers. There are many more ways to get a theater production funded besides Kickstarter. Another analysis could be to create a graph on success based on donation size or based on countries.
